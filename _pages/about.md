Hi! My name is Zeyu Ping, a second-year student from Sun Yat-sen University. Welcome to my homepage! You will meet an future scientist here, hahaha.

My research interest includes robot learning, diffusion model and computer vision. Now, I am working for achieving a strong INTELLIGENT ROBOT. And I believe this is going to be my lifelong dream!

I will be pleasant if you want to operate with me. DO NOT HESITATE TO EMAIL ME!
